data=[1,2,3,4,5]
mean=sum of all the numbers /5

median=mediam is the middle value in the data set (after sorting)
median=3

data1=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

median1 = float(data1[n//2])=we got 4
    #getting the second number
	median2 = float(data1[n//2 - 1])=we got 3



there are two middle values(3,4)
median=(3+4)/2

data2=[10,40,10,10,10,40,30,50]
mode is the most frequently occuring data j the data set
mode=10
